# Dodgeball
A small little "game" that comes in at just `194` lines of code. I wrote this game in order to learn the Pixi.JS library. I dont have any prior experience with game dev and this is my first time trying to make anything resembling a game. Its pretty bad.

## Running
Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
And run the app:
```
npm run dev
```
